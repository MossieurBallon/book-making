			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
			<p>The genesis of this project started in 2010 as a series of independant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">video tutorials</a> published, in French, on YouTube. I felt, in those days, that unfortunately there was a crucial lack of quality material on the art of ballooning in my mother tongue.</p>
			<p>A few years later, in 2014, I started a collection of pdf guides, which consisted in simple step-by-step photographic how-to's, to accompany and complement each videos. In fact, the present e-book is, for a good part, an updated and expanded compilation of those guides.</p>
			<p>Around the same time, after <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/fr/blog/mossieur-ballon-en-inde">a small trip in India</a>, I decided, with the help of my son, Matthieu, to add English subtitles to the video tutorials and translate the PDF guides. And one of my daughters, Sarah, who was living in the Iberian peninsula, offered her help with Spanish translations.</p>
			<p>Thankfully today there is a plethora of choices in most languages, when it comes to balloon tutorials on the Net, from very simple and rough (dare I say... ugly?) models executed quite quickly, to the most beautiful, intricate and impressive ones that require... quite a bit of time.</p>
			<p>But simple does not necessarily rhyme with ugly. Simple <b>can</b> be beautiful!! It is therefore the ambition of these lessons to offer you simple balloon figures that can be realised quite rapidly and yet are effective, artistic and truly beautiful.</p>
			<p>If you are new at balloon twisting, I warmly encourage you to follow these tutorials in the order in which they are presented. This progressive learning curve has been designed to enable you to start balloon twisting really from scratch and yet, you should quite rapidly acquire a definite mastery in this most original art.</p>
			<p>And although these lessons have been conceived with absolute beginners in mind, some of the more advanced folks may still benefit from the numerous tips and reminders on being meticulous. It is precisely these small details and last touches, sadly so often skipped, that divide the professional and true artist from the professional and eternal mediocre. More experienced ballooners may also appreciate some of these simple and effective balloon figures to add to their collection.</p>
			<p>I am myself an avid consumer of the numerous how-to's and tutorials that florish on Internet, allbeit with diverse degree of quality or expertise, whether it be in video, photo or textual form. The contributions of hundreds of generous individuals willing to make time to share their talents and experience, have tremendously helped me throughout the years, not only in the field of balloon art, but in numerous other areas such as software development, computer repair, website creation, business management, personal finances, community projects, home building and repair, organisational, motivational, spiritual and personal growth, gardening, and much more!</p>
			<p>This is why all my material is published on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">Open Source model</a>. Most individual lessons that compose this booklet can be accessed absolutely for free on my <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/">tutorial page</a> while I offer this full compilation as a grateful gesture to anyone who use the donate button on my website. So if you stumbled upon this compiled booklet some other ways and it proved to be helpful to you... Well, now you know what you should do!</p>
			<p>And after this wee words of introduction, please... Enjoy!</p>

			<h2 id="ch1">Chapter 1 - Material needed</h2>
				<h3 id="MatA">A- The balloons</h3>
					<img style="margin:0px 25px 3px 0px; float: left;" src="global-images/twisting-balloon-choice.jpg"/></p>
					<p>This may actually have happened to you.</p>
					<p>You purchased a beginner's kit with the following contents : a hand pump, a set of instructions and... a number of what appears to be twisting balloons.</p>
					<p>Now, you expectantly imagine the happiness and fun you will bring to your child's birthday party and decide to practice a little bit ahead of time. Following the instructions, you start inflating the balloon but - bad luck, surely - it blows up with a loud pop!!</p>
					<p>Hmm... after a deep breath, you start inflating another balloon again, this time a little more slowly and carefully and... with success. Yay!!</p>
					<p>Triumphantly, you undertake the knot but - bad luck, surely - it pops again. Boohoo!!</p>
					<p>Darn!!</p>
					<p>But you are not one to be easily discouraged, so you try again (and again.. and again... and...) until finally you succeed in tying the knot (of the balloon). Yay again!!</p>
					<p>Delving back into the instructions, you start twisting your very first bubble and - bad luck, surely - it pops again. Boohoo!!</p>
					<p>You reach towards the balloons, and it is then you realize with horrified dismay that the whole pack is nearly gone and you only have 3 balloons left for your child's party.</p>
					<p>To make a long story short, you end up utterly frustrated and you quit in despair being fully persuaded that balloon twisting is not for you and that only a very special kind of people can actually do it.</p>
					<p>But guess what ? You simply did not have the right balloon. Yes, you heard correctly, <strong>you didn't have the right balloons!</strong></p>
					<p>I know, it's hard to believe that these lovely balloon kits sell with crummy balloons. But sadly, that seems to be the norm and the reason is simply mercantile; crummy balloons, or crummy anything for that matter, will always be cheaper to manufacture than quality ones.</p>
					<p>There are actually very few companies manufacturing good quality twisting balloons.</p>
					<p>The world leader is Qualatex. <a href="https://europe.qualatex.com/en-gb/products/?product_type=Qualatex+Latex+Balloons&amp;b7d2cd51-590c-4de3-a47d-ce0d05775b18=986">Qualatex</a> offers an incredible array of balloons in all kinds of shapes, colors and sizes, and not only for modeling.</p>
					<p>And a close contender here in Europe is <a href="http://www.sempertex.com/products/index/modelling-balloons">Sempertex</a> who also offers a wide array of balloons, notably the original <a href="http://www.sempertex.com/products/index/link-o-loon">link-o-loon</a> balloons that can be attached from both sides. But I digress.</p>
					<p>Modeling balloons are identified by their diameter and by their length: 160, 260, 321, 350, 360, 646, 660, etc. The first number matching the diameter while the two others match the length.<img style="margin:3px 0px 3px 25px; float: right;" src="global-images/twisting-balloon-sizes.jpg"/></p>
					<p>In other words:</p>
					<p>160 represents a twisting balloon, fully blown, measuring 1 inch wide and 60 inches long.</p>
					<p>260 represents a twisting balloon, fully blown, measuring 2 inches wide and 60 inches long.</p>
					<p>350 represents a twisting balloon, fully blown, measuring 3 inches wide and 50 inches long.</p>
					<p>And so on, and so forth.</p>
					<p>A beginner will usually concern himself only with 260's to start with. Those are the ones used in my "<a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/">Balloon Twisting From Scratch" tutorial series</a>.</p>
					<p>If these 2 brands of balloons are not always sold in brick and mortar shops, you can find and buy them easily on Internet.</p>
					<p>One word of caution though... until you gain more experience, stay away from transparent colors which are a bit more fragile. Those are identified on Qualatex as <a href="https://us.qualatex.com/en-us/products/latex-balloons/solid-color-latex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Jewel</strong></a> colors. For a start, you may prefer the <strong>standard</strong> or <strong>fashion</strong> colors.</p>
					<p>So, in conclusion: <strong>Yes... you... can !!</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Yes</strong>, with the right balloons (and the<a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/"> right instructions</a>) <strong>you</strong> too <strong>can twist balloons.</strong></p>
					<p>Have fun!!</p>

				<h3 id="MatB">B- The pumps</h3>
					<img style="margin:0px 25px 3px 0px; float: left;" src="global-images/balloon-small-pump.jpg"/>
					<p>Here the choice is quasi infinite. Some pumps are operated manually,  some function with electricity, and some even come with compressed air tanks!!</p>
					<p>For the purpose of this series, hand operated pumps will be more than sufficient.</p>
					<p>You might wonder: what about inflating twisting balloons with the mouth?</p>
					<img style="margin:3px 0px 3px 25px; float: right;" src="global-images/balloon-big-pump.jpg"/>
					<p>Well, I usually do not recommended it. Although if done correctly, it should not cause any problem; if done the wrong way, it has the potential to harm your lungs, your eyes or your ears. That is if you do not faint first. In any case, it is not very hygienical, just think of the myriad of rather intimate lung germs that will be spread to the children each time a ballon pops.</p>
					<p>Back to the hand pumps.</p>
					<p>To inflate 260 balloons, I essentially use either one of those two.</p>
					<p>The smaller one comes in handy and can be carried anywhere since it doesn't take much place. Its main drawback is that it requires your elbow to do a few goings and comings before a balloon is fully inflated. That means extra time, and occasional muscle or articulation aches and pains.</p>
					<p>The bigger one, that stands on its own on the ground, is way more bulky. However, it inflates a 260 balloon with only one movement of the hand, which results in less time and less effort. One further advantage is, that the balloon inflated with it, offers a smother and regular surface from top to bottom.</p>
					<p>You can find both types of pumps easily on Internet, allbeit with a diversity of quality and price.</p>

				<h3 id="MatC">C- The pens</h3>
					<img style="margin:0px 25px 3px 0px; float: left;" src="global-images/balloon-markers.jpg"/>
					<p>Any pen with a vivid pigment, and a not-too-sharp tip should do.</p>
					<p>I personnaly am quite fond of the Maxiflo series by Pentel. There is a push button in the rear part of the pen to reinject ink towards the tip.</p>
					<p>Nonetheless I always keep a few by me. That way, if one runs a bit dry after some use, I let it rest and recharge itself for awhile while I take another one. This ensures that my drawings are always crisp and sharp, even at the end of a busy day.</p>
					<p>And I usually try to stick to black pens. If I need some color, I usually try to use balloons for it and only use pens for the most essential facial features.</p>

		<h2 id="end">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>We have now come to the end of this beginner's series on balloon modeling and you may wonder what to do next?</p>
			<p>Well, if you have followed each lesson fully and have devoted the necessary time to practise most of the concepts and skills taught therein, you should now be able to easily follow most other balloon tutorials out there on YouTube, even if they are in a foreign language, just by observing carefully the techniques used.</p>
			<p>I suggest for a start that you pay a visit to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon/channels">other balloon channels that I subscribe to</a> and that I particularly appreciate either for their ingenuity or for the beauty of their realization. But as I said, there are plenty more out there.</p>
			<p>In the meanwhile I wish you all the best!</p>
			<p>Enjoy yourself as you create great balloon sculptures that bring fun and smiles around you.</p>
