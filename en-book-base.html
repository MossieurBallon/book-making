			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
			<p>The genesis of this project started in 2010 as a series of independant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon">video tutorials</a> published, in French, on YouTube. I felt, in those days, that unfortunately there was a crucial lack of quality material on the art of ballooning in my mother tongue.</p>
			<p>A few years later, in 2014, I started a collection of pdf guides, which consisted in simple step-by-step photographic how-to's, to accompany and complement each videos. In fact, the present e-book is, for a good part, an updated and expanded compilation of those guides.</p>
			<p>Around the same time, after <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/fr/blog/mossieur-ballon-en-inde">a small trip in India</a>, I decided, with the help of my son, Matthieu, to add English subtitles to the video tutorials and translate the PDF guides. And one of my daughters, Sarah, who was living in the Iberian peninsula, offered her help with Spanish translations.</p>
			<p>Thankfully today there is a plethora of choices in most languages, when it comes to balloon tutorials on the Net, from very simple and rough (dare I say... ugly?) models executed quite quickly, to the most beautiful, intricate and impressive ones that require... quite a bit of time.</p>
			<p>But simple does not necessarily rhyme with ugly. Simple <b>can</b> be beautiful!! It is therefore the ambition of these lessons to offer you simple balloon figures that can be realised quite rapidly and yet are effective, artistic and truly beautiful.</p>
			<p>If you are new at balloon twisting, I warmly encourage you to follow these tutorials in the order in which they are presented. This progressive learning curve has been designed to enable you to start balloon twisting really from scratch and yet, you should quite rapidly acquire a definite mastery in this most original art.</p>
			<p>And although these lessons have been conceived with absolute beginners in mind, some of the more advanced folks may still benefit from the numerous tips and reminders on being meticulous. It is precisely these small details and last touches, sadly so often skipped, that divide the professional and true artist from the professional and eternal mediocre. More experienced ballooners may also appreciate some of these simple and effective balloon figures to add to their collection.</p>
			<p>I am myself an avid consumer of the numerous how-to's and tutorials that florish on the Net, allbeit with diverse degree of quality or expertise, whether it be in video, photo or textual form. The contributions of hundreds of generous individuals willing to make time to share their talents and experience, have tremendously helped me throught the years, not only in the field of balloon art, but in numerous other areas such as software development, computer repair, website creation, business management, personal finances, community projects, home building and repair, organisational, motivational, spiritual and personal growth, gardening, and much more!</p>
			<p>This is why all my material is published on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">Open Source model</a>. All the individual lessons that compose this booklet can be accessed absolutely for free either on my <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/tutorials/">tutorial</a> or on my <a href="https://www.mossieur-ballon.com/blog/">blog</a> page while the full compilation can be downloaded for a very small fee. So if you stumbled upon this compiled booklet some other ways and it proved to be helpful to you, it would be great if you could download it again through the proper channel so that I too can afford to take time from my regular work days to produce new material. In other words, it would be great if you could help me to help you !</p>
			<p>And after this wee words of introduction, please... Enjoy!</p>

		<h2 id="end">Conclusion</h2>
			<p>You have now come to the end of this book and you may wonder what to do next?</p>
			<p>If you followed each lesson and devoted enough time to practise most of the concepts and skills tought therein, you should now be able to easily follow most other balloon tutorials out there on YouTube, even if they are in a foreign language, just by observing carefully the techniques used. I suggest for a start that you pay a visit to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MossieurBallon/channels">other balloon channels that I subscribe to</a> and that I particularly appreciate either for their ingenuity or for the beauty of their realization. But as I said, there are plenty more out there.</p>
			<p>In the meanwhile I wish you all the best!</p>
			<p>Enjoy yourself thoroughly as you create beautiful and fun balloon sculptures and bring up smiles and happy thoughts around you.</p>
